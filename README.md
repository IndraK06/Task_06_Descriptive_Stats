# Syracuse Men’s Basketball 2024–25: Statistical Analysis with ChatGPT

This project uses the 2024–2025 Syracuse University Men’s Basketball season statistics to test ChatGPT’s ability to interpret, analyze, and answer detailed questions about a real-world sports dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset provides full team and player stats, including:
- Individual player metrics (FG%, 3PT%, FT%, rebounds, assists, steals, turnovers)
- Team totals and averages
- Game-by-game results with scores and attendance
- Performance splits (overall vs. conference, home vs. away)
- Scoring by halves and overtime

*Format:* PDF

## 🤖 Objective
- Feed the season stats to ChatGPT
- Ask targeted statistical and performance questions
- Evaluate accuracy in fact retrieval, derived metrics, and insights

## 🧠 Prompt Questions
- Largest FG% change between conference and overall play
- Rebounds in wins vs. losses
- Top scorer share in close games (≤5 pts)
- Three-point dependency vs. opponents
- Correlation between attendance and scoring margin
- Home vs. away shooting splits

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- Accurate extraction of numeric stats
- Correct computation of derived metrics (percentages, correlations, splits)
- Insightful trends (home-court shooting boost, late-game scoring roles)
- Limits appear when inferring context not explicit in the data (e.g., opponent strength)
